The main purpose of this lab is to:  Create your Linux virtual machine environment using a pre-built imageRemotely connect to your new Linux environmentLearn basic management of VMs from the Azure web interface.  This VM will be used extensively throughout the rest of this course.  While you are working through this lab, it is highly recommended that you write down general notes and commands to help you remember how to do this lab.

Azure sends a signal to the VM to shut down safely.If your VM status says stopped, but does not include the (Deallocated) text, then resources are still being held by the VM and we're still being charged.

This is useful for starting up VMs, shutting them down when unresponsive, and deleting them when you're finished.  (Warning: Do not delete the VM created in this lab!)  IMPORTANT - After creating your VM for the first time, you must log out and log back in to Azure. When you first create a VM in DevTest Labs (DTL) and it's in a fully running state, you need to log out and log back into the Azure Portal for permissions to be added properly to your account. If you don't, you'll get Permission denied warnings from Azure if you try to do this investigation.

Your total allowed resource allocation has been restricted for this course. This means you can only have one VM in existence at a time.
